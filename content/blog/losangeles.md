Keeping with the trend of vacation posts, here's another one!

This week I've been in Los Angeles visiting colleges, museums, and random landmarks. In general, I've just been having fun. 

It's been pretty great so far, the weather is amazing---it says 90 degrees but feels like 70. And Los Angeles is as stunning as ever, and is surprisingly green at this time of the year (probably due to people over-watering their lawns).

The colleges I've visited have all been nice too!

7/3 UCLA - Overall, a really nice campus other than its vastness which may or may not be an issue.

7/5 USC - Eh, maybe it's an acquired taste---the whole thing was gated and looked like a fort, probably because the surrounding community wasn't that great.

7/6 Caltech - Possibly better than UCLA, idk? Very similar to it but it feels much cozier I guess.

7/7 UC Irvine -

Other than that I've been trying to manage ASSIP and the other stuff I talked about last time while on this trip---they've all kicked into high gear so thankfully we had the July 4th! I've also managed to work on my personal statement which is a big relief. It is looking pretty finished but who knows how it will change in upcoming months. 

This is a bit on the shorter end of my blog posts, but that's pretty much all I have to say right now. I'll just conclude, for the first time ever, with a collection of photos from my trip!

Adios!
