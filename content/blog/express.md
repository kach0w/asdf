It's been exactly one month since my last blog post and I have finally decided to get back to updating it. Just this week, I finally decided to get back to something else I always wanted to do but for some reason kept putting off. That things is back-end programming. I have been comfortable with front-end programming for a few months now, but back-end, as I have always known is where the real stuff lies. The nitty-gritty things the user never sees are just as imporant as the UI, maybe even more so. So this week being Ski Break (I know.), and with some free time I started watching tutorials and slowly and steadily have starting picking up the basics of Express JS.

Express is essentially a NodeJs framework for back-end programming. Back-end is what the user never sees or directly interacts with, but it is the core of websites and the web. I had always wanted to build apps like logins, things with databases but I had never gotten around to it. I had been stuck where I was, and I was slightly scared of venturing into something new, where what I knew had grew comfortable to me.

But now that I have starting playing around with Back-end programming, I can see new potential in the things I can build.

I can't wait to see what I can build as I try to become a full-stack developer.
