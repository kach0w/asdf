It’s been almost 3 months, but I’ve finally gotten in the mood to write a new post! 👏

I don’t really know what to talk about, so I’m just going to ramble I guess.

I uh, started a new internship at Daewoong Academy! Done some more ML stuff (finally). Went to Science Fair! That was a lot of fun.

I dunno.

Oh yeah, I finished all my summer apps. Still don’t feel great about them but whatever.

AP’s are coming up soon I guess. No need to worry about them right? Right???

Future me shall see soon. July 5th, the day of reckoning and probably the last time I visit the College Board every year, is and always has been a memorable day.

Junior year seems to be wrapping up.

“You are here” seems to have been January. Ref: Orange County Register

I’m almost in April where the ratio between kinetic and potential energy becomes something I’m too lazy to calculate.

Hopefully, I can get back to biking more like last year. Fremont is surprisingly green right now.

Note to future me: please go to OpenSauce and the Secret Sidewalk if you can. I don’t know if you’re going to be online or in some far off land this summer but try, please try to have an iota of fun.

SENIOR YEAR AHHHHH.

I’m going insane.


Until next time,

P.S. I’m on Chapterhouse Dune, definitely the best book in the series, right?
