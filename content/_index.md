Hey there! I'm a high school student from Fremont, CA. This website is my spot for showcasing projects and occasionally posting on my blog.

I wear many hatsâ€”from being a Wikipedia fanatic and diving into articles about ancient Mesopotamian to researching applications of deep learning and computer vision in projects; my interests span all sorts of things.

When I'm not at my computer or school, you can find me watching movies, riding my bike along the nearby Alameda Creek, or listening to some rock (my favorite bands are R.E.M., the Beach Boys, and the Smiths ðŸ¤˜).
