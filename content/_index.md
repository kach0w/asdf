Hey there! I'm a high school student from Fremont, CA. This website is my spot for showcasing selected projects and the occasional blog post.

I wear many hatsâ€”from diving into books about ancient Mesopotamian civilizations to researching the applications of deep learning in computer vision projects; my interests span a wide range of things.

When I'm not online or at school, you can find me watching movies, riding my bike along the nearby Alameda Creek, or surfing old music forums for some alt rock to listen to (mainly R.E.M. ðŸ¤˜).

Shoot me a message if you want to talk or if you have something fun you'd like to collaborate on. You'll find my email address, as well as some other contact information, down below.
