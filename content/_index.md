Hey there! I'm a high school student from Fremont, CA. This website is sort of my spot for showcasing some selected projects, and the occasional blog post.

I'm a wearer of many hatsâ€”from getting lost in books about ancient Mesopotamian civilizations to researching the applications of deep learning in computer vision projects, my interest span a wide range of things.

When I'm not online or at school, you can catch me watching movies, riding my bike in the nearby Alameda Creek, or surfing old music forums looking for some alt rock to listen to (mainly R.E.M. ðŸ¤˜).

Shoot me a message if you have something fun you want to collaborate on or if you want to talk. You'll find my email address, as well as some other contact information down below.
