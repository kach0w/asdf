Hey there! I'm a high school student from Fremont, CA. This website is my place for sharing projects and occasionally posting on my blog.

I'm interested in machine learning and historyâ€”in particular, the applications of computer vision in my projects, as well as Mesopotamian historicity and 20th-century US history. I frequently delve into these subjects on Wikipedia (I'm a bit of a fanatic).   

When I'm not at my computer, you can find me watching movies, riding my bike along the nearby Alameda Creek, or listening to some rock music (my favorite bands are R.E.M., the Beach Boys, and the Smiths ðŸ¤˜).

Shoot me a message if you want to chat or collaborate on something. You'll find some contact information down below.
