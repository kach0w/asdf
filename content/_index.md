Hello there! I'm a high schooler from Fremont, CA. I use this website to share my projects and write about things.

I'm interested in machine learning and history, especially the applications of computer vision and historicity. I frequently delve into these subjects on Wikipedia (I'm a bit of a fanatic).

When I'm not at my computer, you can find me watching movies, biking along Alameda Creek, or listening to some rock music. My favorite bands are R.E.M., the Beach Boys, and the Smiths ðŸ¤˜.
